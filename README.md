First we have to use a command 
but dont get scared it's preety straight forward 



if u have some Knowledge about terminal go head launch git and go to the folder u want to use git in (The folder in which u want to save progress in ) and type
Command: git init

if u dont have some terminal knowledge dont worry 
Open File manager => Go to folder u want to use git in => Now Right click inside the folder (below u will see option open in Terminal) =>Now Type Command:
Command: git init 


What "git init" does ?
it initializes an empty git repo just means that ur telling git that this is the folder in which i want to track changes.
